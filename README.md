# SubDima
SubDima is just an educational fake trojan / virus. It copies to your temp folder and has a random key to exit.

## Origin
I just came up with random things it *is*, and I discovered manually distributed as one of them.
Manually distributed > Manual Distribution > Anagram= Subdural Intimation > Short= SubDima.

Sadly, I lost the original version (and the source code). So I decided to make a version 2.0.
Here it is!!

## DISCLAIMER
Will get added SoonTM
